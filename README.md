#### This is a GUI practice repository

I perform data analysis and model ML on a daily basis. Working with it I have realized how code has a access barrier that no more than a couple of people around me can pass. Although big data analysis and complex modeling should be centralized in the people with the technical skills to do them correctly many smaller tasks and automations could (and should) be getting available to everyone. To close this GAP, here I am doing some simple projects to learn PySimpleGUI. 

##### [1. My Happy Calculator](../COding/My_Happy_Calculator.ipynb)

The firs project of almost everyone learning a GUI is, more often than not, a calculator. With me this would not be different, but I tried to make it my own with my own style and features beyond the basics. It will not show zeros on the left of numbers, unless it is a decimal number that has zero in the units. It also won't let the user cause errors on the equation by typing multiple operations one after the other. It has some quality of life changes, as using 'รท' ans 'x' in the buttons instead of '/' and '*' and is made to accept both button click as well as keybord typing.
